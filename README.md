## Developed from the Ground Up:
I single-handedly constructed this project from the ground up, utilizing my coding expertise to bring its vision to life. This was due to being the sole team member with the necessary programming capabilities.


## About This Project

## Dual Perspectives for Tailored User Experiences:

This system seamlessly integrates two distinct perspectives, each designed to empower specific user roles with the functionalities they need:

## Voter Perspective:

Grants users the ability to engage in essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within the voting realm.
Key functionalities include:

Casting votes.
Canceling previously cast votes (offering flexibility and adaptability).
Accessing comprehensive voting data, such as total vote counts and historical voting records (enabling informed decision-making and analysis).

## Admin Perspective:

Unleashes an elevated level of control and administrative capabilities.
Encompasses a wider spectrum of CRUD actions, including:

Comprehensive management of voter information, extending to deletion of records along with associated data from auto-cascaded tables (ensuring data integrity and streamlining administrative tasks).
Overseeing other crucial administrative tasks necessary for system maintenance and optimization.
